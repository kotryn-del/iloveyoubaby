    <h1>My Love for You</h1>
    <p>You are my sunshine, my moon, and all my stars. I love you endlessly. ❤️</p>
    
  <p>
      your gaze is a novelty,<br>
Your touch becomes my favourite melody,<br>
On my arms, on my thighs, it writes poetry,<br>
Take my breath, and never breathe out,<br>
You're not someone i can live without,<br>
My hands, my wounds, my quiet fears,<br>
All of me is yours to keep,<br>
Your hands, your wounds, your quiet fears,<br>
We weave them into something deep,<br>
My love, my dreams, my soul, my flaws,<br>
All of me is all i give,<br>
Your love, your dreams, your soul, your flaws,<br>
Become foundation where i can safely build the walls,<br>
With these walls i'll build us a home.,<br>
Something much more greater Rome.,<br>
A home where these walls don’t crack or sever,<br>
A love that needs no doors..not ever.,<br>
One home.,<br>
Two hearts.,<br>
Two souls.,<br>
Four eyes.,<br>
We're building our own paradise.,<br>
      </p>
     <p>
        Together we will wander,<br>
        Hand in hand, heart in heart,<br>
        Forever intertwined,<br>
        Never to be apart.
    </p>
