    <h1>My Love for You</h1>
    <p>You are my sunshine, my moon, and all my stars. I love you endlessly. ❤️</p>

    <!-- Your poem -->
  <p>
      your gaze is a novelty
Your touch becomes my favourite melody
On my arms, on my thighs, it writes poetry
Take my breath, and never breathe out
You're not someone i can live without 
My hands, my wounds, my quiet fears,
All of me is yours to keep
Your hands, your wounds, your quiet fears,
We weave them into something deep
My love, my dreams, my soul, my flaws, 
All of me is all i give
Your love, your dreams, your soul, your flaws
Become foundation where i can safely build the walls
With these walls i'll build us a home.
Something much more greater Rome.
A home where these walls don’t crack or sever,
A love that needs no doors..not ever.
One home.
Two hearts.
Two souls.
Four eyes.
We're building our own paradise.
